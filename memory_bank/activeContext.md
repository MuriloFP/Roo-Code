# Current Work: External API Expansion

## Current Focus: External API Feature

### Recent Changes

- Implemented all core API endpoints
- Added comprehensive test suite with 28 passing tests
- Fixed response format issues in GET /api/modes/current
- Improved error handling and validation messages
- Implemented mode switching functionality

### Current Status

- All planned endpoints are implemented and tested
- CORS security is properly configured
- Error handling is consistent across all endpoints
- Input validation is thorough and user-friendly

### Next Actions

1. Create pull request for the external API feature
2. Add rate limiting to prevent API abuse
3. Enhance logging system for better debugging
4. Add more examples to API documentation

### Open Questions

1. Should we add authentication for sensitive operations?
2. What rate limits would be appropriate for different endpoints?
3. Should we add versioning to the API endpoints?

### Implementation Notes

- Using Express.js for the HTTP server
- Custom CORS middleware instead of cors package
- Consistent error response format across all endpoints
- Mode switching validates mode existence before attempting switch
- All endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes

## Current State

- Basic API server is functional
- Custom instructions endpoints are working
- Basic task management is implemented
- Documentation is being maintained
- Implementation plan is tracked

## Next Actions

1. Begin implementing Mode Management endpoints (highest priority)

    - GET /api/modes
    - GET /api/modes/current
    - POST /api/modes/switch

2. Enhance task management with new features
    - Extended configuration options
    - Task status tracking
    - Response streaming consideration

## Open Questions

1. Should we implement authentication for the API?
2. How should we handle rate limiting?
3. What's the best approach for streaming task responses?
4. Should we implement WebSocket support for real-time updates?

## Implementation Notes

- Keep maintaining documentation as we implement new endpoints
- Focus on proper error handling for each new endpoint
- Consider backward compatibility
- Ensure proper testing coverage
