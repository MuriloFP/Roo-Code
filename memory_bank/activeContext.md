# Current Development Context

## Recent Changes

1. MCP Management Implementation (Complete)

    - Added GET /api/mcps endpoint for listing MCPs
    - Added GET /api/mcps/:id endpoint for MCP details
    - Added POST /api/mcps/:id/status for enabling/disabling MCPs
    - Implemented comprehensive test coverage (81 passing tests)
    - Updated API documentation with MCP endpoints

2. Task Creation Enhancement (Complete)
    - Extended POST /api/tasks endpoint with new parameters:
        - mode: Switch to specific mode before task
        - profile: Switch to specific profile before task
        - wait_for_completion: Wait for task completion
    - Added full test coverage for new parameters
    - Updated API documentation

## Current Focus

Message Sending Enhancement:

- Implementing POST /api/messages/:id endpoint
- This will allow sending messages to specific task conversations
- Currently, messages can only be sent to the active conversation

## Next Steps

1. Message Sending Implementation:

    - Design and implement POST /api/messages/:id endpoint
    - Add task existence validation
    - Add message format validation
    - Implement error handling for non-existent tasks
    - Add comprehensive tests
    - Update documentation

2. Important Notes:
    - Ensure backward compatibility with existing message sending
    - Consider performance implications for large conversations
    - Maintain consistent error handling patterns
    - Follow existing test structure for new endpoint

## Dependencies

- Requires access to task history for validation
- Uses existing message format validation
- Follows current error handling patterns
- Integrates with existing test infrastructure

## Security Considerations

- Validate task IDs to prevent unauthorized access
- Maintain existing CORS protection
- Consider rate limiting for message endpoints
- Ensure proper error message sanitization

# Current Work: External API Expansion

## Current Focus: Profile Management and Task Status Tracking

### Recent Changes

- Completed all mode management endpoints with full test coverage:
    - GET /api/modes (lists built-in and custom modes)
    - GET /api/modes/current (retrieves active mode)
    - POST /api/modes/switch (handles mode switching)
- Fixed response formats and validation messages
- Added comprehensive test suite with 28 passing tests
- Improved error handling across all endpoints
- Revised implementation plan for better modularity
- Implemented profile management endpoints:
    - GET /api/profiles: List all available profiles
    - GET /api/profiles/current: Get current profile
    - POST /api/profiles/switch: Switch between profiles
- Added comprehensive test coverage for all profile endpoints
- Integrated with ConfigManager for profile operations
- Added proper error handling and validation
- Implemented task status endpoints (GET /api/tasks/status and GET /api/tasks/:id/status)
- Added comprehensive test coverage for all endpoints (43 passing tests)
- Updated API documentation with new endpoints and response formats
- Improved error handling and status tracking
- Completed all task-related endpoints:
    - Task creation with enhanced parameters
    - Task listing with pagination
    - Task status retrieval (current and specific tasks)
    - Task logs retrieval (current and specific tasks)
- Added comprehensive test coverage for all endpoints
- Updated API documentation with detailed examples and response formats
- Fixed various linter errors and improved error handling

### Current Status

- Mode Management feature is complete and tested
- Core API endpoints are stable and working
- CORS security is properly configured
- Input validation is thorough
- Test coverage is comprehensive for existing features
- New implementation plan established
- Profile management endpoints are fully implemented and tested
- All tests passing (37 tests total)
- API documentation is up to date
- Error handling and validation in place
- All planned API endpoints are implemented and tested
- Documentation is up to date with latest changes
- Test coverage is comprehensive with all tests passing
- Known issues documented and tracked

### Next Actions

1. Implement WebSocket support for real-time updates
2. Add rate limiting to protect API endpoints
3. Enhance error messages with more detailed information
4. Clean up duplicate mock files
5. Consider implementing authentication
6. Design response format for settings endpoint
7. Add tests for new endpoints
8. Update API documentation

### Open Questions

1. Should we implement WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for real-time updates?
2. What rate limiting strategy should we use?
3. Do we need to implement authentication for the API?
4. How should we handle concurrent task operations?
5. How does RooCode store auto-approve settings?
6. Should auto-approve settings be per-profile or global?
7. What specific actions should be included in auto-approve settings?
8. How to handle concurrent changes to auto-approve settings?

### Implementation Notes

- Need to extend ClineAPI interface for new task options
- Consider using event emitters for task status updates
- Plan to implement proper state management for tasks
- Will need to track task history and conversation logs
- Consider implementing a task queue for better management
- Need to investigate current auto-approve implementation in RooCode
- Consider security implications of auto-approve settings
- Plan for backward compatibility
- Consider adding validation for specific auto-approve actions

## Technical Considerations

1. Task State Management

    - Track task status
    - Handle session persistence
    - Manage task history

2. Response Handling

    - Implement completion waiting
    - Handle streaming responses
    - Manage task approvals

3. Error Scenarios
    - Task creation failures
    - Status tracking errors
    - Log retrieval issues

## Current State

- Basic API server is functional
- Custom instructions endpoints are working
- Basic task management is implemented
- Documentation is being maintained
- Implementation plan is tracked

## Implementation Notes

- Keep maintaining documentation as we implement new endpoints
- Focus on proper error handling for each new endpoint
- Consider backward compatibility
- Ensure proper testing coverage

## Dependencies

- Need to understand current auto-approve implementation
- May need to modify existing auto-approve logic
- Documentation needs to be updated after implementation

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for new endpoints
2. Integration tests with existing auto-approve functionality
3. Error handling tests
4. Concurrent access tests
