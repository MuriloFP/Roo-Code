# Current Work: External API Expansion

## Current Focus: Profile Management and Task Status Tracking

### Recent Changes

- Completed all mode management endpoints with full test coverage:
    - GET /api/modes (lists built-in and custom modes)
    - GET /api/modes/current (retrieves active mode)
    - POST /api/modes/switch (handles mode switching)
- Fixed response formats and validation messages
- Added comprehensive test suite with 28 passing tests
- Improved error handling across all endpoints
- Revised implementation plan for better modularity
- Implemented profile management endpoints:
    - GET /api/profiles: List all available profiles
    - GET /api/profiles/current: Get current profile
    - POST /api/profiles/switch: Switch between profiles
- Added comprehensive test coverage for all profile endpoints
- Integrated with ConfigManager for profile operations
- Added proper error handling and validation

### Current Status

- Mode Management feature is complete and tested
- Core API endpoints are stable and working
- CORS security is properly configured
- Input validation is thorough
- Test coverage is comprehensive for existing features
- New implementation plan established
- Profile management endpoints are fully implemented and tested
- All tests passing (37 tests total)
- API documentation is up to date
- Error handling and validation in place

### Next Actions

1. Implement Task Status and Response endpoints:

    - GET /api/tasks/:id/status
    - GET /api/tasks/:id/logs

2. Finally, enhance POST /api/tasks endpoint with:
    - Mode selection (using existing endpoints)
    - Profile selection (using new profile endpoints)
    - Timeout parameter (default 5 minutes)
    - Auto-approve toggle
    - Wait-for-completion with response

### Open Questions

1. How should we handle task state persistence between sessions?
2. What's the best approach for implementing wait_for_completion?
3. Should auto_approve be limited to specific modes or users?
4. How should we structure the conversation logs?
5. Should we implement WebSocket support for real-time task status updates?
6. What should be the default timeout value for task completion?
7. How should we handle concurrent profile switches during active tasks?

### Implementation Notes

- Need to extend ClineAPI interface for new task options
- Consider using event emitters for task status updates
- Plan to implement proper state management for tasks
- Will need to track task history and conversation logs
- Consider implementing a task queue for better management

## Technical Considerations

1. Task State Management

    - Track task status
    - Handle session persistence
    - Manage task history

2. Response Handling

    - Implement completion waiting
    - Handle streaming responses
    - Manage task approvals

3. Error Scenarios
    - Task creation failures
    - Status tracking errors
    - Log retrieval issues

## Current State

- Basic API server is functional
- Custom instructions endpoints are working
- Basic task management is implemented
- Documentation is being maintained
- Implementation plan is tracked

## Next Actions

1. Begin implementing Mode Management endpoints (highest priority)

    - GET /api/modes
    - GET /api/modes/current
    - POST /api/modes/switch

2. Enhance task management with new features
    - Extended configuration options
    - Task status tracking
    - Response streaming consideration

## Open Questions

1. Should we implement authentication for the API?
2. How should we handle rate limiting?
3. What's the best approach for streaming task responses?
4. Should we implement WebSocket support for real-time updates?

## Implementation Notes

- Keep maintaining documentation as we implement new endpoints
- Focus on proper error handling for each new endpoint
- Consider backward compatibility
- Ensure proper testing coverage
