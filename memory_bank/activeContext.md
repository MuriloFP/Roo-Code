# Current Development Context

## Recent Changes

- Implemented auto-approve settings endpoints:
    - GET /api/auto-approve: Get current settings
    - POST /api/auto-approve: Update all settings
    - POST /api/auto-approve/enabled: Toggle master switch
- Added comprehensive test coverage for auto-approve endpoints
- Updated API documentation with auto-approve endpoints
- All tests passing (61 tests)

## Current Focus

Task Enhancement Implementation:

- Planning to extend POST /api/tasks endpoint with additional parameters
- Researching streaming response implementation
- Need to consider:
    - What new parameters to add
    - How to implement streaming responses
    - Best practices for timeout handling
    - Integration with auto-approve settings

## Next Steps

1. Design new parameters for POST /api/tasks:

    - Research required parameters
    - Consider backward compatibility
    - Plan validation requirements

2. Research streaming response implementation:

    - Evaluate WebSocket vs Server-Sent Events
    - Consider impact on existing code
    - Plan testing approach

3. Implementation:
    - Add new parameters to task creation
    - Implement streaming if decided
    - Add timeout handling
    - Update tests and documentation

## Notes

- All auto-approve functionality is now complete and tested
- Need to maintain backward compatibility when adding new task parameters
- Consider performance implications of streaming responses
- Keep security in mind when implementing new features

# Current Work: External API Expansion

## Current Focus: Profile Management and Task Status Tracking

### Recent Changes

- Completed all mode management endpoints with full test coverage:
    - GET /api/modes (lists built-in and custom modes)
    - GET /api/modes/current (retrieves active mode)
    - POST /api/modes/switch (handles mode switching)
- Fixed response formats and validation messages
- Added comprehensive test suite with 28 passing tests
- Improved error handling across all endpoints
- Revised implementation plan for better modularity
- Implemented profile management endpoints:
    - GET /api/profiles: List all available profiles
    - GET /api/profiles/current: Get current profile
    - POST /api/profiles/switch: Switch between profiles
- Added comprehensive test coverage for all profile endpoints
- Integrated with ConfigManager for profile operations
- Added proper error handling and validation
- Implemented task status endpoints (GET /api/tasks/status and GET /api/tasks/:id/status)
- Added comprehensive test coverage for all endpoints (43 passing tests)
- Updated API documentation with new endpoints and response formats
- Improved error handling and status tracking
- Completed all task-related endpoints:
    - Task creation with enhanced parameters
    - Task listing with pagination
    - Task status retrieval (current and specific tasks)
    - Task logs retrieval (current and specific tasks)
- Added comprehensive test coverage for all endpoints
- Updated API documentation with detailed examples and response formats
- Fixed various linter errors and improved error handling

### Current Status

- Mode Management feature is complete and tested
- Core API endpoints are stable and working
- CORS security is properly configured
- Input validation is thorough
- Test coverage is comprehensive for existing features
- New implementation plan established
- Profile management endpoints are fully implemented and tested
- All tests passing (37 tests total)
- API documentation is up to date
- Error handling and validation in place
- All planned API endpoints are implemented and tested
- Documentation is up to date with latest changes
- Test coverage is comprehensive with all tests passing
- Known issues documented and tracked

### Next Actions

1. Implement WebSocket support for real-time updates
2. Add rate limiting to protect API endpoints
3. Enhance error messages with more detailed information
4. Clean up duplicate mock files
5. Consider implementing authentication
6. Implement Auto-Approve Settings endpoints:
    - GET /api/auto-approve: Retrieve current settings
    - POST /api/auto-approve/settings: Update settings
    - POST /api/auto-approve/toggle: Enable/disable auto-approve
7. Research how RooCode currently manages auto-approve settings
8. Design response format for settings endpoint
9. Add tests for new endpoints
10. Update API documentation

### Open Questions

1. Should we implement WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for real-time updates?
2. What rate limiting strategy should we use?
3. Do we need to implement authentication for the API?
4. How should we handle concurrent task operations?
5. How does RooCode store auto-approve settings?
6. Should auto-approve settings be per-profile or global?
7. What specific actions should be included in auto-approve settings?
8. How to handle concurrent changes to auto-approve settings?

### Implementation Notes

- Need to extend ClineAPI interface for new task options
- Consider using event emitters for task status updates
- Plan to implement proper state management for tasks
- Will need to track task history and conversation logs
- Consider implementing a task queue for better management
- Need to investigate current auto-approve implementation in RooCode
- Consider security implications of auto-approve settings
- Plan for backward compatibility
- Consider adding validation for specific auto-approve actions

## Technical Considerations

1. Task State Management

    - Track task status
    - Handle session persistence
    - Manage task history

2. Response Handling

    - Implement completion waiting
    - Handle streaming responses
    - Manage task approvals

3. Error Scenarios
    - Task creation failures
    - Status tracking errors
    - Log retrieval issues

## Current State

- Basic API server is functional
- Custom instructions endpoints are working
- Basic task management is implemented
- Documentation is being maintained
- Implementation plan is tracked

## Implementation Notes

- Keep maintaining documentation as we implement new endpoints
- Focus on proper error handling for each new endpoint
- Consider backward compatibility
- Ensure proper testing coverage

## Dependencies

- Need to understand current auto-approve implementation
- May need to modify existing auto-approve logic
- Documentation needs to be updated after implementation

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for new endpoints
2. Integration tests with existing auto-approve functionality
3. Error handling tests
4. Concurrent access tests
