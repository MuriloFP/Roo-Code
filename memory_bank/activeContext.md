# Current Work: External API Expansion

## Current Focus

We are expanding the RooCode External API to include comprehensive endpoint coverage for all major RooCode features. The initial implementation of basic endpoints (instructions and simple task management) is complete, and we are now planning the implementation of additional endpoints.

## Recent Changes

1. Updated API documentation to clarify global vs mode-specific instructions
2. Created comprehensive documentation for planned endpoints
3. Established implementation tracking in progress.md

## Current State

- Basic API server is functional
- Custom instructions endpoints are working
- Basic task management is implemented
- Documentation is being maintained
- Implementation plan is tracked

## Next Actions

1. Begin implementing Mode Management endpoints (highest priority)

    - GET /api/modes
    - GET /api/modes/current
    - POST /api/modes/switch

2. Enhance task management with new features
    - Extended configuration options
    - Task status tracking
    - Response streaming consideration

## Open Questions

1. Should we implement authentication for the API?
2. How should we handle rate limiting?
3. What's the best approach for streaming task responses?
4. Should we implement WebSocket support for real-time updates?

## Implementation Notes

- Keep maintaining documentation as we implement new endpoints
- Focus on proper error handling for each new endpoint
- Consider backward compatibility
- Ensure proper testing coverage
